# The Gallows Story

You have been trialed for a crime you never committed. It's the day of your execution and just as the clock nears the date to hang. 
You hope that a the Lawyer you hired can try to save the day. Suddenly, he bursts into the room and now it's your time to save your life.  

# My Goals

My goals is to craft the most in-depth variant of Hangman. With many subjects from all corners of the English language.
I hope to expand the story as much as I can and I have the hopes of making The Gallows one of the most greatest video
games of all time.
