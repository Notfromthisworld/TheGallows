The Ark

The changes needed in saving oneself during a harsh period of time means that everyone must sacrifice what they have so they can live just a little bit longer. We are faced with such challenges and those who have families will do whatever they take to prevent anything happening and do others who have pets and etc etc etc.

We are on the cusp of something big happening to us all. Now, you may assume that I’m being paranoid and you can think whatever you want. But the truth is everything has become trash. Life now seems like a struggle even with all the advancements in technology that we have at our disposal. A lot of people want a better life, a better opportunity to survive in this ever-growing hectic world, and well that’s why I do what I do. I’m here trying to create something that will survive the test of time with the lowest requirements necessary to survive any kind of technological emergency.

With the way everything is going we must protect our technological footprint from all means of sabotage by weapons that can and will send us back to the stone age. I have taken it upon myself in creating an ark of sorts. In the best means of protecting my work for future generations. Protecting the English language just in case when the world comes to an end. In the hopes of preserving the future in case of some sorta Fallout type scenario. I am also working on a capsule of sorts protecting my legacy which I am currently designing. These posts are by means of a documented map of sorts. In the hopes of bringing about some sort of sanity in a world gone crazy.
